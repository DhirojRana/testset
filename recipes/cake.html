        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple vanilla sponge cake perfect for beginners. Cream together butter and 
            sugar until fluffy, then mix in eggs and vanilla essence. Sift flour and baking powder together 
            and fold into the wet ingredients along with milk to make a smooth batter. Pour it into a greased baking pan 
            and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 30–35 minutes. Let it cool,
             then enjoy plain or with frosting.</p>
