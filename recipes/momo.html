        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Momo is a popular Nepali dumpling filled with spiced minced meat or vegetables. To make it, knead flour and water
             into a soft dough, and let it rest. Prepare the filling by mixing ground meat (like chicken or buff) or finely 
             chopped veggies with onion, garlic, ginger, green chili, and salt. Roll out the dough into small circles, add the 
             filling, and fold them into dumpling shapes. Steam them for 10–15 minutes
             and serve hot with spicy tomato chutney.</p>
